#Super Misc
This challenge is insane. Here it goes...

1. You are given a bunch of sha1 hashes. Create your own hash table to crack them. 
2. The cracked hashes are a port knocking sequence, once knocked, it opens up HTTP
3. When you request HTTP, you get a '404' page, which gives you a base64 encoded 'error code'. This is the user agent you need to use
4. Once you use the correct user agent in your web request you get the real page. Once you view source you find a rot13 text. This gives you a clue about port knocking sequence
5. Once you port knock, it opens up a mini game where you have to beat the RNG to guess the broker's favourite number (it's based on a bad seed for the RNG which uses user input for the seed). You should script the fuck out of this section.
6. Once you get the favourite number right, you are given a pcap to download (there is a password to download it, and you are given that too). 
7. The pcap has a covert channel over http (ip 192.168.253.139) partial content requesting 3 files and their passwords. 
8. When you download the files and put them together you get the flag. Hooray! Use dd to put the files together.
