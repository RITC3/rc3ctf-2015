This challenge is pretty basic. You are initially presented with a page that isn't very helpful. But upon viewing the source of the page, there is a comment about stopping web crawlers from scraping pages. This is a hint to check robots.txt. In this file there are a couple directories listed. The one titled admin is a decoy, and the flag can  be found in a file in the directory titled secret.

Flag: ***RC3-ROBOTZ-559672***
