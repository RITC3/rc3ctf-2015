Diagnostics - 300 Points
========================
This challenge has two diagnostics interfaces. One will ping a given IP address or hostname and the other will perform a forward dns lookup only. The goal is for you to achieve OS command injection on the first site (ping) and cat a file called creds. This username:password combination will give you access to the second site that does dns lookups. The goal on the second site is to achieve command injection as well, except this time it's a little harder than before.
